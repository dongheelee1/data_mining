quick overview 

data mining - the process of extracting patterns from data for some purpose such as making predictions

general formula for data mining 
1. get data 
2. get pattern from data
3. apply pattern to do something

supervised learning vs. unsupervised learning
supervised learning has labels (Y values), find patterns in fully observed data and apply to partially observed data 
unsupervised learning doesn't have labels, find hidden patterns in data


continuous variables vs. discrete variables
continuous variables have continuous values (e.g. [0, 1]) 
discrete variables have finite values (e.g. "spam" and "ham")
